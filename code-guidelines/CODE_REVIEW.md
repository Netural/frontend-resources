# Code Review Guidelines

## Friendly Reminder - just keep in mind... 
* You will get better with every code review.
* Your colleagues will get better with every code review thanks to your help.
* Don’t take it personally, the review is of the code, not you.


## Having your code reviewed
* General: Use the [Merge Request Template](https://github.com/Netural/netural-boilerplate/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request/Merge%20Request.md)
* Ask for special advises if needed (Is this approach in foo() good enough?)
* Make sure your code is aligned with the [Netural Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/Netural/frontend-resources/tree/master/code-guidelines)


## Reviewing code
* Don’t command changes, ask for an opinion/change. (What do you think about doing it this way?)
* Try to be as specific as possible or talk to your colleague about some changes.


## Goals
* We become better developers
* We get a deeper understanding of different projects
* We work more closely together as a team
